##SaaS Build Tool for the Ionic Framework

###About
Ionic Builder is a cloud build service for Android (and maybe, eventually, iOS) applications built using the Ionic framework.

Builder came from an idea, a question and a desire to build something cool using a few technologies that I've been meaning to do something with. 

###Todo
* Add GitHub webhook support
* Pretty up the interface
* Unit tests!
* Make the elapsed timer still work if the user refreshes the page during the build.
